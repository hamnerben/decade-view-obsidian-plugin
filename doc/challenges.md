# retrospective

1. I started out working on the donut charts when that was too much "in the weeds". Now that I stepped back and just trying to get obisidan to display something in the view, I can see where I need to go next. 

2. There was a long feedback loop in experimenting with the API. I found that I could open the console within the obsidian developer console to test out API features.

3. I keep running into problems and I keep backing up and backing up until I realize I'm not doing `npm run`.  Dangit

4. I learned a lot from my React dev class and now I realize some changes I should implment so I refactored it. 

5. The obsidian CSS is very strong. I think I might need to simplify the UI by just highlighting a cell if it has at least 1 note in that week.  Then I will make an interface on the right that allows navigation through the week.

**11-6-24** - The app instance is not registering all the commands. It seems like I might need to delay the instantiation of the app. I will try that next time.
